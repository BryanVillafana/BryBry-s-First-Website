  <h1 style="color: rgb(139, 42, 224)"> Andre 3000 is an underrated superstar </h1>
  <p> The rap duo Outkasts was composed of 2 people, Andre 3000 and Big Boi </p>
<p> Outkast started out making street music, like selling drugs and stuff. </p>
<p> But then they upgraded to "I don't know what the hell I'm listening to" kind of music</p>
<p> After that they finally settled on "Strap your seat belts we're going to mars" kind of music</P>
<p> Andre 3000 was able to innovate on all these different genres which makes him, as of now, <Strong> the greatest rapper alive </strong>
  <p> People can never really agree on who is the best main stream rapper ever.</p>
  <p> But we can all agree on who are some of the worst rappers of this time </p>
